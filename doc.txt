Precision farming is a modern farming approach that uses technology and data to optimize field-level management.
It improves productivity, quality, and sustainability by monitoring soil, crops, and environmental conditions.
Farmers can use sensors, GPS, and AI tools to make precise decisions on irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
This approach reduces waste, saves resources, and increases profitability while minimizing environmental impact.
